void main() {
  // Declare an int variable and let Dart infer its type
  var age = 20;
  var jop = "Software engineering";

  // Define a variable with an explicit String type
  String name = "Sok_Sothy";
  int qty = 10;

  // Output
  print(age);
  print("----------------------");
  print(jop);
  print("----------------------");
  //Output

// Explain how Dart infers the type of variable.
// Answer : Dart guesses the type of a variable from the value you give it.
// This makes your code shorter and easier to write, while still keeping it safe.
// Dart looks at what you're putting into the variable and picks the best type for it.
// You cna put the specific data type if you want to like String ,int ,final
